This project was to create a full stack web application using Mongoose and Express on top of MongoDB and Node. 

---

## Site Specifics

The idea of the site is to allow people from a specific occupation create currated lists of the software that they use on a day to day basis and why they use it. People will have a chance to share lesser known pieces of software to other users and allow people to learn about better ways of getting their job done

## Tech Specs

This is a brief overview of the technology used in making this project

* **MVC**: This site is built using as many model, view, controller concepts to segment out functions and blocks of code to allow for easy readability 
* **Mongoose**: We are using MongoDB for the database in the backend with Mongoose methods to allow us to CRUD more effectively 
* **SCSS/CSS**: I used SCSS to handle styling
* **Bootstrap**: We ended up suing the boostramp framework to quickily build out templates and in our EJS files
* **EJS**: We used EJS to do server side HTML rendering. 
* **Passport**: Passport was also implemented to configure local auth. 

## Features

* Users can visit the site and view user profiles without authenticating 
* Users can create an account to make their own currated lists of software. 
* User can create and update their own profile informatin as well as their list of software that they would like to share 

## Incompletes

* Users are not able to add software that isn't in the database already
* Users are not able to upvoate different lists
